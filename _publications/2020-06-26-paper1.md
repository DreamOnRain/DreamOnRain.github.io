The convection heat transfer coefficient is an important parameter of Industrial equipment temperature field distribution calculation.A new method for measuring the natural convection heat transfer coefficient about horizontal cylinders based on schlieren have been introduced.The method utilizes the "z" reflective schlieren system to visualize the density gradient and temperature gradient over a large field of view.The convection heat transfer coefficient have been calculated via a combination of image analysis and numerical calculation.The results show that the schlieren method is a simple and feasible method for measuring the convection heat transfer coefficient about horizontal cylinders.
